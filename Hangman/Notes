- Consider case sensitivity of characters/strings

1) Create view that draws a keyboard of buttons + guess word button
    - Custom buttons that contain a character property of what they represent
2) Get every button from that view and assign an action target to a "guess letter" function
    - also assign guess word button to a "guess word" function

1) Create a view that draws labels for each letter in the word
2) Have it update on each guess

1) Create a view with a hangman drawing with 6 pieces
2) Have a function that fills in those pieces given a guesses/max-guesses ratio


- first new game gives same word??
